#creating a variable
x=5
y="jhon"
print(x)
print(y)

#casting of variables
x=str(3)
y=int(2)
z=float(3)
print(x,y,z)

#getting the type of the variable
print(type(x));
print(type(y));
print(type(z));

#string can be written in both the single and double quotes both are same

#python is case sensitive and A variable and a variable both are different and treated as different


#variable names can be  in camel case and start with the _ at the beginning

#multiple variable sare assigned multiple values
x,y,z="orange",12,"mango"
print(x,y,z);

#one value to multiple variables
x=y=z="orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#unpack a collection
#if we have a collection of values in list tuple form then in python we can extract these in to varibles



#global variables
# global varables are the variables which are defined outside the function and can be accessed both inside and outside .


# to create a global variable inside a function we use global keyword to make it global
